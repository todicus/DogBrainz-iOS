This project uses an embedded Bluetooth Low Energy board (Punch Through Design's Bean) on the collar with a tiny audio module to speak and play feedback sounds. Different sounds can be queued from your smartphone, and there's integration with gesture-tracking smart devices (Nod) for easier control. Finally, an internet-connected treat dispenser (SparkCore) delivers rewards.

- Impress your friends with your mad training skillz.
- Pretend your dog can talk
